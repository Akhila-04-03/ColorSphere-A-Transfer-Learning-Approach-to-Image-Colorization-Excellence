# ColorSphere-A-Transfer-Learning-Approach-to-Image-Colorization-Excellence
This project develops an image colorization network using an Encoder, Fusion Layer, and Decoder, with VGG16 as a feature extractor. By utilizing LAB and YUV colorspaces instead of RGB, the model achieves more realistic colorization.This approach highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning and deep learning techniques in enhancing image colorization.
