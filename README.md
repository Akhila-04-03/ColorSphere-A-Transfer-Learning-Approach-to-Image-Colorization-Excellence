# ColorSphere-A-Transfer-Learning-Approach-to-Image-Colorization-Excellence
Image colorization is the process of assigning colors
to a grayscale image, transforming it into a visually plausible
and perceptually meaningful color image. This technique is vital
for restoring historical photos, enhancing medical images, and
improving the visual quality of old, damaged images. This paper
develops an image colorization approach using the ECCV16
and SIGGRAPH17 models, both of which leverage convolutional
neural networks and transfer learning to achieve high-quality
colorizations. By utilizing the LAB colorspace instead of RGB,
the models achieve more realistic and vibrant colorization. This
approach highlights the effectiveness of transfer learning and
deep learning techniques in enhancing image colorization.
